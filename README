hashref provides a simple mechanism for tracking the 
content of files across renaming, and for deduplication.

On execution the .hashref directory is created on the 
current path, tracking the contents of every file below it.

USAGE:
hashref [ [ -u ] [ -d ] [ -p ] ] | [ [ -v ] | [ -h ] ]

OPTIONS:
  -u: deduplicate files
  -p: purge before running
  -v: version
  -d: debug
  -h: this message


The hash of every file below the current folder is
calculated, and using it, every file is hardlinked
inside .hashref.

The first 2 characters of the hash, segregate the
folder hierarchy. The rest of the hash is used as
filename.

If the -u option is recived, the names of every 
file will be recreated with the same inode as those
under .hashref.

A special file called version is kept inside .hashref
for future incompatibilities.

Instructing rsync to preserve hardlinks while including
.hashref will avoid the transfer of files on the basis
of renaming.
