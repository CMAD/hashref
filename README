hashref provides a simple mechanism for tracking the 
content of files across renaming.

On execution the .hashref directory is created on the 
current path, tracking the contents of every file below it.

USAGE:
hashref [ [ -f PATH ] [ -p ] [ -d ] ] | [ [ -v ] | [ -h ] ]

OPTIONS:
  -f: src folder
  -p: purge before running
  -d: debug
  -v: version
  -h: this message

Files are hardlinked inside the .hashref/objects folder
with a name matching it's sha1 hash.

The first 2 characters of the hash, correspond to a 
directory name, the rest is used for the actual filename. 

A special file called VERSION is kept inside .hashref
for future incompatibilities.

Instructing rsync to preserve hardlinks while including
.hashref will avoid the transfer of files on the basis
of renaming.
