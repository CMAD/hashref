hashref provides a simple mechanism for tracking the 
content of files across renaming.

USAGE:
hashref [ [ -f PATH ] [ -p ] [ -d ] ] | [ [ -v ] | [ -h ] ]

OPTIONS:
  -f: src folder
  -p: purge before running
  -d: debug
  -v: version
  -h: this message

Instructing rsync to preserve hardlinks while including
the .hashref directory will avoid the transfer of files
on the basis of renaming.

On the first run every file below either the current
folder or the value of -f is hardlinked on .hashref.

A persistent name is given to it's copy by using it's
sha1 hash.

While using it's contents means creating a new reference
when it changes and deleting previous ones. A clean run 
will produce the same results no matter the host it's run.

The first 3 characters of the hash, correspond to a 
directory name, the rest is used for the actual file. 

The hardlinks are kept below .hashref/objects.

A per-host inode-to-name mapping in .hashref/refs is used
to purge old references when a file changes.

Before running, the .hashref/CURRENT modification time is
updated. On completion .hashref/PREVIOUS reflects 
.hashref/CURRENT value.

Subsequent runs use .hashref/PREVIOUS to only take 
newer files into account.

A file called VERSION is kept inside .hashref
for future incompatibilities.
